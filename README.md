# Vidjot
An application where content creators can register and jot down and manage ideas for future videos

The project is quite simple where I have used Express routing, middleware, templates, Mongoose, etc. I have implemented Passport and a local strategy where i store emails as usernames and encrypted passwords in our database. I have deployed this app to Heroku.
